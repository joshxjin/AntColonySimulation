# AntColonySimulation
This is a simple ant colony simulator writen in Java and JavaFX.

Run App.java, click on "Generate Nodes" to randomly generate a graph, with start node (red), target node (blue) and 20 intermediate nodes (beige), with each node randomly connected to its surrounding nodes based on the distance apart. Clicking "Generate Nodes" again will recreate a new simulation with new random nodes.

Start simulation will create initial 500 ants to start the simulation. To increase the number of ants, use "Add 50 ants" or "Add 200 ants".

Over time there will be a convergent solution (not neccessary the most opitimal solution).
